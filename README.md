# Stacker
I was at the movies with my kids and they were fascinated with the Stacker game (actual photo below) and the cool prizes you can win if you Stack to the Top. I said "I reckon I can make that game!". They said "Sure Dad!".

## A Game A Day

I found this really cool youtube series and then a link to Kaelinator/AGAD Github repository (https://github.com/Kaelinator/AGAD) which had a simple version of Stacker using p5.js (I love this Javascript library - https://p5js.org).

## Modification

So I modified the code slightly to show a closer resemblance to this arcade version. My kids loved it!

## Gameplay

Use the spacebar to try to stack the blocks to the top. You will start with 3 blocks but you will likely only have 1 block by the time you get to the top as the speed increases as the score increases. You can play the game here: https://neilwoodroffe.github.io/stacker/
